So you want to code with React, huh?
Well, there's an easy way to set up your project with React, but I don't recommend it. You'll be able to create React components, but not to their full potential - You won't have access to JSX (well, you could if you include babel-standalone, but it slows down your project a lot), and your code will have to be either in one giant <script> tag, or distributed among many scripts with careful attention to their order. 

1) Just include the CDN version of react and react-dom in your <head> tag

2) Write your React code in a <script> tag at the end of your <body> tag

You'll notice that your React code will look just as messy as your jQuery code, so what's the real benefit of doing it this way?

The NPM way is the better way
Setting up React with npm is more complicated, but it opens up the opportunity to use JSX and require() statements in your code. You won't have to worry about ordering <script> tags, or finding the latest CDN url. 

1) Install express-generator globally with: npm install express-generator -g

2) Generate a new express project with: express your-project-name

      2a) Delete your views folder, you don't need it!

      2b) Have your servers' index route serve up a static index.html file 

2*) Alternatively, you could just set up an express server from scratch

3) Install these packages:

npm install react

npm install react-dom

npm install -g browserify

npm install babelify babel-core

npm install babel-preset-react babel-preset-es2015

4) Add this script in your package.json file (make sure you put it in the "scripts" object):

"build": "browserify -t [ babelify --presets [ babel-preset-react babel-preset-es2015 ] ] path/to/your/main.js -o path/to/your/compiled/file"

5) In your index.html, add a single <script> tag that points to your compiled JS file

create-react-app is the easiest way
1) Install create-react-app globally with: sudo npm install create-react-app -g

2) Generate a new react project with: create-react-app your-project-name

3) cd into the new directory, npm install, and then run your app with npm start! Your react code should be in the /src folder
